# 📌 Project Overview

This project documents the setup of a personal cybersecurity laboratory environment created during **Week 01** of my **NetworkWalks Cybersecurity Internship**.

The objective was to build a controlled virtual environment that can be safely used for future cybersecurity learning, testing, and practical exercises.

The lab was designed using:

- VMware Workstation
- Kali Linux Virtual Machine
- NAT Networking
- Host-Only Networking
- Network Verification Testing
- Snapshot-Based Recovery

---

# 🎯 Lab Purpose

Cybersecurity activities often require isolated environments where tools and configurations can be tested without affecting the host operating system.

Virtualization provides:

- Safe experimentation
- Environment isolation
- Easy recovery
- Repeatable lab setups
- Network segmentation

For this lab:

- **VMnet8 (NAT)** provides Internet connectivity.
- **VMnet2 (Host-Only)** provides an isolated laboratory network.

This design allows Internet access while maintaining a separate network segment for future cybersecurity exercises.

# 🌐 Step 5 — Kali Network Configuration

After configuring the second network adapter, Kali Linux detected two interfaces.

| Interface | Address |
|------------|-----------|
| eth0 | 192.168.72.128/24 |
| eth1 | 10.0.0.129/24 |

### Verify Interfaces

```bash
ip addr
```

Expected Result:

```text
eth0 -> 192.168.72.128/24
eth1 -> 10.0.0.129/24
```

# 🌐 Step 6 — Routing Verification

The routing table confirmed:

- Internet traffic uses eth0
- Lab traffic uses eth1

Command:

```bash
ip route
```

Observed Routing Table:

```text
default via 192.168.72.2 dev eth0 proto dhcp src 192.168.72.128 metric 100

10.0.0.0/24 dev eth1 proto kernel scope link src 10.0.0.129 metric 101

192.168.72.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.72.128 metric 100
```

# ✅ Step 7 — Connectivity Testing

## Internet Connectivity Test

Command:

```bash
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8
```

Result:

```text
4 packets transmitted
4 received
0% packet loss
```

## DNS Resolution Test

Command:

```bash
ping -c 4 google.com
```

Result:

```text
Replies successfully received
```

# 🔄 Snapshot & Recovery

After completing the base laboratory configuration, a VMware snapshot was created (or planned) to provide a recovery point.

Benefits:

- Safe experimentation
- Easy rollback
- Malware analysis preparation
- Rapid recovery from misconfigurations

# ⚠️ Problems Encountered & Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|-----------|-----------|
| Reference implementation used VirtualBox | Adapted the setup for VMware Workstation |
| Host-only lab network was not initially available inside Kali | Added a second VMware network adapter |
| Kali initially only showed eth0 | Configured VMnet2 and attached it to the VM |
| Ping to 10.0.0.1 failed before host-only setup | Verified network adapter configuration and routing |

### Key Observation

Before the second adapter was configured:

```text
eth0 = 192.168.72.128
```

After adding VMnet2:

```text
eth1 = 10.0.0.129
```

The routing table then displayed:

```text
10.0.0.0/24 dev eth1
```

confirming successful connection to the isolated laboratory network.
